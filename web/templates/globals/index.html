    <h1 id="hello-friends-">Hello Visitor!</h1>
    <p>I am Tim and this is my website! As I am the best Hackerboy in town and not some lame <em>mediadesign</em> dude, this page is not the prettiest. However, it is the fastest, most reliable and best in all other categories.</p>
    
    <h5 id="things-to-do-">What you can do here:</h5>
    <p>This page has a few subpages, each dedicated to a different somewhat usefull application.</p>
   
    <h3 id="watcher">Watcher</h3>
    <p>Here, you can monitor the CPU and Memory Load and number of Goroutines (this page is build using GO) that are used by this Page/Server.</p>
    
    <h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
    <p>Here, you can create or join a Chatroom, and then chat in real time.</p>

    <h3 id="locator-io">Locator-IO</h3>
    <p>On this subpage, you can play a little game, where you need to find a Location, using only satelite imagery.
    Amazingly, you can do so against somebody else.
    The rules are simple, click at the location you think is correct, and at the end of a round your are awarded points.
    Currently you can play a few certain regions and locations. However the points awareded are not yet influenced by the size of the area. 
    This shall be addressed in further releases.</p>

    <h3 id="contact">Contact</h3>
    <p>If by some unforseen miracle this page crashes, you like this page but want more 'Regions' or you want to support this page 
    consider yourself forced to contact me at <em>mlsch@mailbox.org</em></p>
