        <h3 id="locator-io">Locator.io</h3>
        <p>Play alone or against friends. Purpose of the game is to locate a city with only satellite imagery as a base.
        Get points based on distance to actual location. Most points win. Uses Websockets for realtime communication.
        Visually very basic. Not optimized for Phones, yet. </p>

        <p>Here, you can monitor the CPU and Memory Load and number of Goroutines (this page is build using GO) that are
            used by this Page/Server.</p>


        <h3 id="chat">Chat</h3>
        <p>Here, you can create or join a Chatroom, and then chat in real time. Pretty basic, but no government tracking! I swear.</p>
